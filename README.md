# AI-Assisted Learning Tool

## Overview
This project aims to enhance learning efficiency by providing an AI-assisted tool that processes educational content, particularly from YouTube videos. It's designed for learners who have limited study time and need to grasp key concepts quickly and effectively.

## Objective
To develop a solution that efficiently extracts and processes information from educational videos, transforming it into concise, AI-generated summaries or explanations.

## Features
- **YouTube Transcript API**: Integrates with YouTube to extract video transcripts.
- **AI Processing**: Utilizes an AI model (like GPT) to analyze and summarize the video transcripts.
- **Optimized Response Time**: Addresses the challenge of lengthy AI response times, especially during peak hours.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Long Response Times**: Initially faced with AI server response times of up to 2.5 minutes.
  - **Optimization**: Implemented strategies to reduce the response time significantly.
- **Content Accuracy**: Ensures the AI-generated content accurately reflects the key points of the original videos.

## Current Status
- The tool, structured as a full-stack application, is operational but not yet deployed to the public.
- Continuous improvements are being made based on testing and feedback.

## Installation and Usage
(Currently in development. Instructions will be provided once the tool is deployed.)

## Contributing
- Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome to improve the tool.
- Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any enhancements.

## Future Goals
- **Deployment**: To make the tool accessible for public use.
- **Lang-chain**: I believe a prompt response using another form of AI will give me more prompt opportunities. Particularly how these transcripts hold up in an evolving tech-environment. This will also significantly reduce the loading times
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback mechanisms for ongoing improvement.
- **Content Expansion**: Expand to include additional educational content sources.
